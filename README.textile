h1. Gherkinspec

_You got Cucumber in my RSpec!_

Write Cucumber-flavored integration tests as easily as you write your RSpec.


h2. To Get Output Like This

Output from a @rake spec:integration@ run:

  User accepting a colleague request
    Scenario:  accepting
      Given I am on my incoming colleague requests page
        When I press "Add as Colleage"
          Then I should be on the colleagues list page
          And I should see the requestor's name
          When I sign in as the requestor
            When I go to the colleagues list page
              Then I should see the requestee's name

h2. Make a Feature Like This

Put it in a .feature file in the _spec/integration_ folder. Here's
_user_accepts_colleague_request_spec.rb_ for example:

  require File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'spec_helper'))

  Feature "User accepting a colleague request" do
    Scenario "accepting" do
      Given "I am on my incoming colleague requests page" do
        executes do
          @user = Factory(:user)
          @requesting_user = Factory(:user)
          make_colleague_request(@requesting_user, @user)
          login_as(@user)
          visit colleagues_path(:type => 'requested')
        end
        
        When %(I press "Add as Colleage") do
          executes { click_button 'Add as colleague' }
          
          Then "I should be on the colleagues list page" do
            current_url.should == colleagues_url
          end
          
          And "I should see the requestor's name" do
            response.body.should contain_text(@requesting_user.name)
          end
          
          When "I sign in as the requestor" do
            executes do
              logout
              login_as(@requesting_user)
            end
            
            When "I go to the colleagues list page" do
              executes { visit colleagues_path }
              
              Then "I should see the requestee's name" do
                response.body.should contain_text(@user.name)
              end
            end
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end


h2. Just Set Up Your Spec Helper Like This

Meld these lines into your existing _spec/spec_helper.rb_:

  require 'webrat'
  require 'spec/support/integration'
  require 'gherkinspec'

  Webrat.configure do |config|
    config.mode = :rails
  end

  Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
    config.include(Webrat::Matchers, :type => [:integration])
  end

  class ActionController::Integration::Session; include Spec::Matchers; end

h1. Gherkinspec

_You got Cucumber in my RSpec!_

Write Cucumber-flavored integration tests as easily as you write your RSpec.

h2. To Get Output Like This

Output from a @rake spec:integration@ run:

<pre>
<code>
User creates a vurl
  Scenario:  creating
    Given I am on the home page
      When I submit a valid vurl
        Then I should be on vurl stats page
        And I should see a success message
        And my vurl was successfully created
</code>
</pre>

h2. Make a Feature Like This

Put it in a spec file in the _spec/integration_ folder. Here's
_user_creates_vurl_spec.rb_ for example:

<pre>
<code>
require File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'spec_helper'))

Feature "User creates a vurl" do
  Scenario "creating" do
    Given "I am on the home page" do
      executes { visit root_path }

      When "I submit a valid vurl" do
        executes do
          fill_in "vurl_url", :with => 'http://example.com'
          click_button 'Vurlify!'
        end

        Then "I should be on the vurl stats page" do
          current_url.should == stats_url(Vurl.last.slug)
        end
        And "I should see a success message" do
          response.body.should include('Vurl was successfully created')
        end
        And "my vurl was created" do
          Vurl.last.url.should == 'http://example.com'
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
</code>
</pre>

h2. Just Set Up Your Spec Helper Like This

Meld these lines into your existing _spec/spec_helper.rb_:

<pre>
<code>
require 'webrat'
require 'spec/support/integration'
require 'gherkinspec'
</code>
</pre>
